## Overview
[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/contains-tasty-spaghetti-code.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

A discord bot custom-built for my personal discord server. While still in active development, the bot already has many useful and fun features including coinflips, dicerolls, 8-ball requests, rock paper scissors, and information queries. What sets Gunther apart from other bots is his unique personality: he responds using custom-written speech consistant with his digital character.

Gunther is a fairly typical multi-purpose utility bot, with many well-known and common features such as automod, chat leveling, and welcome messages. However, what makes Gunther unique is the way that he interacts with your server's members and the additional functionality he provides to provide the idea that Gunther is a real person, with thoughts, opinions, ideas and desires as much as a real person would.

## Features
[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-javascript.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

Gunther is currently in **closed alpha**. This means that many of Gunther's primary features are either incomplete or not present at all, and the bot will only be available to a small pool of hand-chosen testers until the bot is ready to move to open beta. Currently there is no release window for moving to open beta.

Gunther's features are divided into groups of related functionality called Suites. Organising things this way offers additional control of Gunther's functions, allowing server admins to customize the bot to suit their needs, enabling the suites they use and disabling the ones they don't.

Gunther's flagship features include:
- Gunther's Forge, a virtual blacksmithing shop where Gunther will create weapons, tools and various items that users can purchase with earned currency (more on that below)
- a Job system, where users can apply for a virtual job and complete various tasks to earn an income of currency
- Some additional functionality related to Forge items, Jobs and currency that I haven't quite decided on just yet. Stay tuned...

Here's some of the additional features that are completed or mostly completed:
- A few fun commands (/8ball, /rps)
- A handful of useful utility commands (/avatar, /coinflip, /decide, etc)
- A welcome message system, allowing server admins to set a custom message that the bot will send for every member who joins the server

Here's some of the additional features that are in partially complete or have not had work done on them yet:
- Logging functions, allowing server admins to keep tabs on everything that happens in their server, even while they're not around
- Reaction roles, allowing members to react to a message with an emoji to gain a predefined server role
- Moderation, offering additional functions to allow server moderators to help keep the riffraff of Discord in check
- Birthdays, let Gunther know when your birthday is and he'll send you a Happy Birthday message (and maybe something else, too!)
- Automod, helping to automate the more tedious and time-consuming parts of moderating a Discord community
- Suggestions, allowing members to post feedback and ideas for server admins, who then can approve or deny certain ideas
- Tickets, for server admins who use their server as a place to offer support with their projects or services
- Server Stats, so you can see fun stats about your server and stuff
- ModMail, to make contacting server moderators more streamlined and professional for those who like their moderation with a touch of elegance
- Holidays, where Gunther will announce public holidays
